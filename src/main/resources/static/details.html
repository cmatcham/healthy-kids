					Helen and Amos love getting out with their kids, be it a game in the park or a bike ride to the shops. But they&#8217;ve also found lots of fun ways for their kids to be active indoors.

					Helen and Amos believe that the way children go to sleep is the way they wake up. They&#8217;ve set up routines to make sure their children go to bed feeling safe, comfortable, and relaxed.

					<ul>
						<li>Walk, run, and play with your child.</li>
						<li>Have fun and be active together as a family.</li>
						<li>Try a new activity together. Look for low- or no-cost activity ideas on the <a href="http://myfamily.kiwi/activities">My Kiwi</a> website.</li>
						<li>What was fun when you were a kid? Teach these games to your children.</li>
						<li>Encourage your child to play outside as much as possible.</li>
						<li>It’s about getting out and about in your local community. Check out your local playgrounds, swimming pools, beach, trees for climbing, walking tracks and parks.</li>
						<li>You can search for activity ideas in your region at <a href="http://myfamily.kiwi/activities">myfamily.kiwi/activities</a></li>
						<li>Join a team, cultural groups, or church group (dancing, kapa kaka)</li>
						<li>Children can have lots of fun with basic equipment such as balls, balloons, kites, buckets, spades, skipping ropes, etc.</li>
						<li>Instead of short car trips, try walking, biking or scooting with your child.</li>
						<li>Use your imagination! Build a hut, make an obstacle course, or paint a mural on your fence.</li>
						<li>Some great indoor activity ideas are dancing, table tennis, skittles, hide and seek, party games (musical statues, musical chairs).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="info-container__text" ng-show="vm.current_activity.value=='nutrition'">
					<ul>
						<li>Children are smaller than adults so don’t need to eat as much.</li>
						<li>Have a smaller plate or bowl for your child.</li>
						<li>Let your child serve themselves.</li>
						<li>Children’s tastes change, so keep offering food they’ve turned down.s</li>
						<li>Children don’t need sugary drinks. Water and low-fat plain milk are the best drinks.</li>
						<li>Eat meals together as a family.</li>
						<li>Make sure TV and other screens are turned off.</li>
						<li>Breakfast is a great way to start the day.</li>
						<li>Choose healthy snacks like fruit, vegetables, low-fat yoghurt, crackers and cheese.</li>
						<li>Canned and frozen fruit and vegetables are just as good as fresh.</li>
						<li>Buy fruit and vegetables when they’re in season – they’re cheaper and fresher.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="info-container__text" ng-show="vm.current_activity.value=='sleep'">
					<ul>
						<li>Quiet activities such as stories or puzzles are good before bed.</li>
						<li>Physical activity during the day will help your child sleep at night.</li>
						<li>As much as possible, have a regular bedtime and wake up time for your child.</li>
						<li>Your child’s bedtime routine could include cleaning teeth and a wash, changing into nightwear, quiet time (books, song, storytelling, prayer), cuddles and kisses, being tucked in.</li>
						<li>Children need a regular place to sleep.</li>
						<li>Their sleeping area should be a place that is dark, warm, dry, cosy, quiet and somewhere they feel safe.</li>
						<li>Have no distractions in the place where children sleep, including TVs and other screens.</li>
